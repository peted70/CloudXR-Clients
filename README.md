# Containers for Building and Developing CloudXR Client Applications

This repo is designed to serve two purposes:

- To build the NVidia CloudXR Oculus VR Client application for receiving the stereoscopic frames from a CloudXR Server
- To provide a development container to allow extending the client application

## Build

A build will run automatically when changes are pushed to `main`. Alternatively, you can trigger the workflow manually.

The build will build a Docker container configured with an Android development environment
